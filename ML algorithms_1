Data science ma 5 questions solve huncha:
Q1 Is this A or B? -------------- Classification algorithm
Q2 Is this weird? --------------- Anomaly algorithm
Q3 How much or how many? -------- Regression algorithm
Q4 How is this organized? ------- clustering algorithm
Q5 What should be done next? ---- reinforcement learning

ML algorithms
classification algorithm
- used to classify a record
- tyesta prashna ma use huncha jasma limited number of answers huncha
	aja garmi cha? yes or no
	ghumna jane ho? yes, no or may be
2 wota matrai choice cha vane 2 choice classification
2 vanda dherai choice cha vane multi choice classification

Anamoly detection algorithm
ajib value detect garne 
10 jana ma 9 jana ko tie cha ekjana ko chaina 
tyo tie navako anamoly ho
bank haru le card ma tyo use garna milcha 
pattern and weird pattern check garera


Regression algorithm
numeric value calculate garna use huncha 
voli ko temperature kati huncha?
kunai product ko average rating kati huncha?

clustering algorithms
separates data into clusters
unsupervised learning ma parcha
data kasari organized huncha vanne herera we can predict the behavior of 
a particular event

reinforcement algorithm
manche ko dimag le reward ra punishment ma adharit garne kam ma depend huncha
similarly, system learn from outcomes and decide on next action vanne concept
ho 
effective for systems that needs to make lot of small decisions without human 
guidance
temperature control system ma ghataune ki badaune vanne herne
chess game is good example 


classification in ML
is a process of categorizing a given set of data into classes 
both structured and unstructured ma kam garcha 
process starts with predicting the class of given data points 
class lai target label or categories vanincha 
eg:
heart disease
binary classification ho
either disease huncha or hudaina 
training dine esko lagi
ani thaha huncha heart disease huncha ki nai vanera
classification supervised learning ho
so target is provided with input data


types of learners in classification
lazy learner
	simply store the training data and wait until a testing data appears
	classification ko lagi most related data use huncha 
	have more predicting time in comaprison to eager learner
	eg KNN
	
eager learner
	constructs a classification model based on the given training data before
	getting data for prediction
	training ma dherai time lincha 
	eg decision tree
	naive bayes 
common classification problems are:
face recognition
speech recognition
	
binary classification problem or multi class problem huna sakcha
some of the ML algorithm for classification are:
logistic regression
K-nearest neighbor KNN
decision tree
Support vector machine (svm)
Naive Bayes
Random forest 
Artificial neural network
stochastic gradient descent 


logistic regression
is a classification algorithm in ML that uses one or more independent 
variables to determine an outcome
the outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable i.e it will have 
only two possible outcomes

goal of logistic regression is finding best fitting relation between dependent
variable and set of independent variables
it's better than other like KNN since it quantitatively explains the factors
leading to classification
adv:
determines how a set of independent variables affects the outcome of a 
dependent variable
disadv:
it only works when the predicted variable is binary
so it assumes that the data is free of missing values and predictors are
independent of each other
eg:
heart disease detection
weather prediction 


Naive Bayes classifier
is a classification algorithm based on Bayes theorem which gives an 
assumption of independence among predictors
it assumes that presence of a feature in class is unrelated to the presence
of any other feature
- related cha vane pani probability independently add garcha 
-easy to make and is good for large data sets
- simple vayera pani it normally outperforms most of other classification
methods in ML
