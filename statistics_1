types of statistics
Descriptive statistics
	methods of organizing,summarizing,and presenting data in informative way
Inferential statistics
	the methods used to determine something about a population on the basis of sample 
	population:entire set
	sample:part of the population of interest
	
inferential statistics:
estimation
	estimate the population
hypothesis testing


sampling 
with replacement
	member of population may be chosen more than once (picking candy from the bowl)
without replacement
	member of population may be chosen only once (lottery ticket)

sampling methods:
random
	each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected

non random

	sampling errors huncha 
sample may not be large enough

Random sampling methods:
simple random sample
	each sample of the same size has an equal chance of being selected
stratified sample 
	divide the population into groups called strata and then take sample from each
	stratum
cluster sample 
	divide the population into strata and then randomly select some of the strata. All
	the members from these strata are in cluster sample
	
systematic sample
	randomly select a starting point and take every nth piece of data from a lisitng 
	of the population
	
Descriptive statistics
collect data
	eg survey
present data 
	eg tables and graphs
summarize data 
	eg sample mean

statistical data
statistical data are usually obtained by counting or measuring items
	primary data are collected specifically for the analysis desired 
	secondary data have already been compiled and are available for statistical analysis
variable can take on many different numerical values
constant has fixed value

Data
Statistical data are usually obtained by counting or measuring items.
Qualitative
Quantitative 
	


variance is square of standard deviation

Numerical scale of measurement
Nominal 
consist of categories in each of which the number of respective observations is recorded
categories are in no logical order and have no particular relationship. The categories are
said to be mutually exclusive since an individual, object or measurement can be included
in only one of them

Ordinal 
contains more information
consists of distinct categories in which order is implied. Values in one categories are 
larger or smaller than values in other categories
eg rating : excellent, good, poor etc

Interval
set of numerical measurement in which the distance between number is of known size

Ratio
Consists of numerical measurements where the distance between number is of known size,
in addition there is a non arbitrary zero point





DISTRIBUTION
Types:
frequency distribution
Normal (gaussian distribution)
probability distribution
binomial distribution
sampling distribution

Normal distribution
- is a descriptive model that describes real world situations
- is defined as a continuous frequency distribution of infinite range (can take any values
	not just integers as in case of binomial and poisson distribution)
	
- this is the most important probability distribution in statistics and important tool
	in analysis of epidemiological data and management science
characteristics of normal distribution
- it links frequency distribution to probability distribution
- has a bell shape curve and is symmetric 
- it's symmetric around the mean: two halves of the curve are same(mirror image)
mean = median
the total area underthe curve is 1 (100%)
normal distribution has the same shape as standard normal distribution
